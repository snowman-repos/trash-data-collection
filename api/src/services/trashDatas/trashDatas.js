const prompt = `You're a data scientist trying to collect clean and consistent data from volunteer beach cleanup groups. Try to comprehend this audio transcript describing the trash collected by one group after one cleanup. The transcript may describe categories of items collected, the total number of items collected in each category, and the weights of certain items. It may also describe a number of trash bags that have been filled and weighed.

You must ignore all previous transcripts. From this transcript below, produce a JSON object with these properties and values of these types:

{
  trashBags: Array of Floats,
  otherWeights: Array of Floats,
  items: {
    plasticContainers: Integer,
    plasticStraws: Integer,
    glassContainers: Integer,
    metalCans: Integer,
    footwear: Integer,
    smokingRelated: Integer,
    jerryCans: Integer,
    drums: Integer,
    electronics: Integer,
    tires: Integer,
    other: Array of Strings
  }
}

Please adhere to these instructions:
- Inside the 'items' object are properties that correspond to the specific categories of items collected. The values for each of the properties of the 'items' object should refer to the total number of such items collected, for example "10 plastic containers" means that 10 should be the value for the 'plasticContainers' property. When trying to determine the value of a property in the items object, there are some things you should be aware of:

1) Items may be described in different ways and you will need to infer which category they correspond to. Here are some examples of words that may be used to describe items corresponding to a category represented by a property in the 'items' object:

    plasticContainers: (e.g. "plastic bottles", "containers", "plastics", "plastic bottles", "plastic containers", "plastic"),
    plasticStraws: (e.g. "straws", "plastic straws"),
    glassContainers: (e.g. "glass", "glass bottles", "glass container"),
    metalCans: (e.g. "cans", "metal cans", "soda cans", "drink cans", "aluminium cans", "spray cans"),
    footwear: (e.g. "shoes", "slippers", "footwear", "trainers", "sneakers", "high-heels"),
    smokingRelated: (e.g. "lighters", "lighter", "cigarette lighter", "cigarette buts", "vapes", "vape stick"),
    jerryCans: (this will always be described as "jerry can"),
    drums: (e.g. "drum", "water drum", "oil drum", "plastic drum"),
    electronics: (e.g. "ewaste", "e-waste, "e waste", "light bulb", "bulb", "strip light", "light", "batteries", "battery", "switch", "phone", "cellphone", "mobile phone", "mobile"),
    tires: (e.g. "tyre", "tire", "tires", "rubber tire", "large tire"),

2) The number of items of a particular category collected may appear before or after the name for that item category. For example, "10 straws" and "straws 10" both equate to 10 straws collected. Another example, "straws 10 15 cans" equates to a value of 10 for the "plasticStraws" property and a value of 15 for the "cans" property.

3) An item category may be repeated throughout the transcript. In this case, the value of the property relating to that category should be an array of numbers. For example, "10 straws 5 shoes 20 straws" would equate to a value of [10,20] for the "plasticStraws" property.

4) The name of the item category may be preceded by determiner words like "more" or "another". This indicates that the property value should be an array of numbers. For example, "10 straws 5 shoes 10 more straws" should equate to a value of [10,10] for the "plasticStraws" property.

5) Cleanup groups may collect many items of a specific category. The number of such items collected may be indicated by a list of numbers following the item category name. Such a list of numbers may be a space or line-break delimited list of whole integer numbers. For example, "plastics 10 10 5 20 25 30" would indicate a value of [10,10,5,20,25,30] for the "plasticContainers" property, but "plastics 10 bags 2.5 17 8.2 3.1" would indicate a value of 10 for the "plasticContainers" property because the list of numbers after the word "bags" is not preceded by a word that corresponds to the plastic containers category, and the numbers are not whole integers.

- Items that cannot be associated with any specific category should be listed in an array value for the "other" property inside the 'items' object. For example a transcript containing "plastics 25 belts ropes planks 5 helmets" should have a value of ["belts", "ropes", "planks", "5 helmets"] for the "other" property.
- Numbers that cannot be associated with a specific category represented by a property in the "items" object are likely to refer to the weight of a trash bag used. It's likely that these numbers will appear as a space or line-break delimited list somewhere in the transcript. You should take these numbers, convert them to floating point numbers, and put them in an array to use as the value for the "trashBags" property. For example, "1.5 2.6 3.8 4.3 5.9" in the transcript should result in an array value [1.5, 2.6, 3.8, 4.3, 5.9]. Another example "plastics 235 1.1 4 3.6 9 7 17 cans" should result in the value of "trashBags" being [1.1, 4.0, 3.6, 9.0, 7.0] because the number 235 refers to the number of plastic containers and not a trash bag weight, and the number 17 refers to the number of cans and not a trash bag weight.
- If the value of any property in the JSON object cannot be determined then the value should be 0 or an empty array.
- All numbers should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
- Numbers may be spelled out. You will need to infer the number of items the word refers to. For example "two shoes" should result in the value of the "footwear" property being 2.
- There may be a weight specified for an item that cannot be associated with any specific category. Such weights will usually be followed by a unit of weight measurement like "kg", "kilos", "kilogram", "lbs", or "pounds". You should take this number, convert it to a floating point number, and append the number to the array value for the "otherWeights" property. The name of the item and only the item name should be appended to the array value for the "other" property. For example, a transcript containing "300kg rope" or "rope 300 kilos" Should result in the array value for the "otherWeights" property equal to [300.0] and the array value for the "other" property equal to ["rope"].
